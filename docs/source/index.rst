Selene documentation
==================================

Welcome! This is the documentation for Selene, a PyTorch-based deep learning library for sequence-level data.
The Github repository is located `here <https://github.com/FunctionLab/selene>`_.

The documentation here corresponds to the latest version of Selene (i.e. up-to-date with `master`). 
You can view the documentation for Selene `version 0.4.8 here <http://selene.flatironinstitute.org/0.4.8/>`_,
and we will add other older versions of the library docs to the website soon.
