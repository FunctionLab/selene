Tutorials
=========

Please view the tutorials in the `Github repository <https://github.com/FunctionLab/selene/tree/master/tutorials>`_.
The README is helpful for figuring out what examples will be most useful to you.

The code to run the case studies presented in the Selene manuscript is `available in the repository <https://github.com/FunctionLab/selene/tree/master/manuscript>`_ as well. 

Note the tutorials and case studies were created with earlier versions of Selene, and we have not updated them to be compatible with newer versions of Selene yet. We're happy to work with you on your use case if you post in our `Google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selene-sdk>`_ or e-mail (kchen@flatironinstitute.org). Thank you!
