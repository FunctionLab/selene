class BedFileSampler(FileSampler):
    """
    A sampler for which the dataset is loaded directly from a `*.bed` file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath : str
        The path to the file to load the data from.
    reference_sequence : selene_sdk.sequences.Sequence
        A reference sequence from which to create examples.
    n_samples : int
        Number of lines in the file. (`wc -l <filepath>`)
    sequence_length : int or None, optional
        Default is None. If the coordinates of each sample in the BED file
        already account for the full sequence (that is,
        `end - start = sequence_length`), there is no need to specify
        the sequence length. If `sequence_length` is not None, the length
        of each sample will be checked to determine whether the sample
        coordinates need to be truncated or expanded to reach the
        sequence length specified in the model architecture.
    targets_avail : bool, optional
        Default is False. If `targets_avail`, assumes that it is the
        last column of the `*.bed` file. The last column should contain
        the indices, separated by semicolons, of features (classes) found
        within a given sample's coordinates (e.g. 0;1;45;60). This assumes
        that we are only looking for the absence/presence of each feature
        within the interval.
    n_features : int or None, optional
        Default is None. If `targets_avail` is True, must specify
        `n_features`, the total number of features (classes).

    Attributes
    ----------
    filepath : str
