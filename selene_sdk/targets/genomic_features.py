"""
This class contains methods to query a file of genomic coordinates,
where each row of [start, end) coordinates corresponds to a genomic feature
in the sequence.

It accepts the path to a tabix-indexed .bed.gz file of genomic coordinates.

This .tsv/.bed file must contain the following columns, in order:
    chrom ('1', '2', ..., 'X', 'Y'), start (0-based), end, feature
Additionally, the column names should be omitted from the file itself
(i.e. there is no header and the first line in the file is the first
row of genome coordinates for a feature).

class GenomicFeatures(Target):
    """
    Stores the dataset specifying sequence regions and features.
    Accepts a tabix-indexed `*.bed` file with the following columns,
    in order:
    ::
        [chrom, start, end, strand, feature]


    Note that `chrom` is interchangeable with any sort of region (e.g.
    a protein in a FAA file). Further, `start` is 0-based. Lastly, any
    addition columns following the five shown above will be ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_path : str
        Path to the tabix-indexed dataset. Note that for the file to
        be tabix-indexed, it must have been compressed with `bgzip`.
        Thus, `input_path` should be a `*.gz` file with a
        corresponding `*.tbi` file in the same directory.
    features : list(str)
        The non-redundant list of genomic features (i.e. labels)
        that will be predicted.
    feature_thresholds : float or dict or types.FunctionType or None
        Default is None. A genomic region is determined to be a
        positive sample if at least one genomic feature peak takes
        up a proportion of the region greater than or equal to
        the threshold specified for that feature.

        * `None` - No thresholds specified. All features found in\
                   a query region are annotated to that region.
        * `float` - A single threshold applies to all the features\
                    in the dataset.
        * `dict` - A dictionary mapping feature names (`str`) to \
                   threshold values (`float`), which thereby assigns\
                   different thresholds to different features. If a\
                   feature's threshold is not specified in this \
                   dictionary, then we assume that a key `"default"`\
                   exists in the dictionary that has the default \
                   threshold value we should assign to the feature \
                   name that is absent from the dictionary keys.
        * `types.FunctionType` - define a function that takes as \
                                 input the feature name and returns\
                                 the feature's threshold.

    init_unpicklable : bool, optional
        Default is False. Delays initialization until a relevant method
        is called. This enables the object to be pickled after instantiation.
        `init_unpicklable` must be `False` when multi-processing is needed e.g.
        DataLoader. Set `init_unpicklable` to True if you are using this class
        directly through Selene's API and want to access class attributes
        without having to call on a specific method in GenomicFeatures.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data : tabix.open
        The data stored in a tabix-indexed `*.bed` file.
    n_features : int
        The number of distinct features.
    feature_index_dict : dict
        A dictionary mapping feature names (`str`) to indices (`int`),
        where the index is the position of the feature in `features`.
    index_feature_dict : dict
        A dictionary mapping indices (`int`) to feature names (`str`),
        where the index is the position of the feature in the input
        features.
    feature_thresholds : dict or None

        * `dict` - A dictionary mapping feature names (`str`) to thresholds\
        (`float`), where the threshold is the minimum overlap that a\
        feature annotation must have with a query region to be\
        considered a positive example of that feature.

        returned by a tabix query are annotated to the query region.
